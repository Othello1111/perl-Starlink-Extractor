This README describes the Starlink::Extractor Perl module.

Extractor (in Starlink-speak, SExtractor everywhere else) is
an source-detection and extraction program. This Perl module
presents a Perl interface to the Starlink version of the
application for use in Perl programs.

To be able to use this module you must have Starlink Extractor,
which can be obtained from the Starlink Project at
http://www.starlink.ac.uk.  To point this module to your
version of Extractor, set the EXTRACTOR_DIR environment variable
to the directory containing the Extractor binary. Under a
standard Starlink installation this environment variable
will be set for you upon sourcing the Starlink etc/login and
etc/cshrc files, and will be typically set to /star/bin/extractor.

This module was written and is supported by Brad Cavanagh
(b.cavanagh@jach.hawaii.edu).
